<!-- ======================================================== -->

<section name="Common Operations">

<subsection name="Extract PDS4 Product Metadata">
<p>
Run Harvest tool to crawl PDS4 products and extract metadata. 
The metadata is stored in an "intermediate" XML file which can be loaded into Solr 
by Registry Manager or Solr post tool.
</p>
<p>
In addition to some basic information, such as lid, vid, product class, internal references, 
file name and size, you can configure additional fields to export.
Optionally the whole PDS product labels can be stored as BLOBs (Binary Large OBjects).
</p>
<p>
See <a href="/operate/harvest.html">Harvest Documentation</a> for more information.
</p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="Create or Delete Registry Collection">
<p>
You must create registry collection in Solr, before loading data generated by Harvest tool.
See <a href="/install/registry.html">Registry Installation</a> and 
<a href="/operate/reg-manager.html">Registry Manager</a> for more information.
</p>
<p>
You may want to add more fields to default schema or change default Solr configuration.
See <a href="/operate/reg-collection.html">Registry Collection Configuration</a> and
<a href="https://lucene.apache.org/solr/guide/documents-fields-and-schema-design.html" target="_blank">Solr Documentation</a>
for more information.
</p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="Load Metadata into Solr">
<p>
Intermediate XML file generated by Harvest, can be loaded into Solr 
by <a href="/operate/reg-manager.html">Registry Manager</a> or standard 
<a href="/operate/solr-tools.html">Solr tools</a>, such as Solr post tool. 
</p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="Delete Metadata from Solr">
<p>
You can use <a href="/operate/reg-manager.html">Registry Manager</a> tool to delete metadata 
by lidvid, lid, package id (Harvest run id), or to delete all data.
</p>
<p>
You can also delete data from Solr by calling Solr update API 
<source>
$ curl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/registry/update/' --data-binary "&lt;delete&gt;&lt;query&gt;*:*&lt;/query&gt;&lt;/delete&gt;"
</source>
</p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="Reingest Data to Registry">
<p>
Registry collection uses lidvid as a primary key. If you load data multiple times, 
old documents will be replaced by new documents with the same lidvid.
To avoid any orphan records, you may want to delete old documents first.
</p>
</subsection>

<subsection name="Export a File from Registry BLOB">
<p>
If PDS product label BLOBs (Binary Large OBjects) were generated by Harvest, they can be exported 
by <a href="/operate/reg-manager.html">Registry Manager</a> tool.
