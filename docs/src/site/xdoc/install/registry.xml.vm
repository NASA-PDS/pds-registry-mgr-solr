<section name="Registry Collection">

<p>
Registry stores its data in Apache Solr. You must create registry collection in Solr before loading the data.
</p>

<p>
Registry manager comes with default registry "configset" located in <i>REGISTRY_HOME/solr/collections/registry</i> directory. 
It consists of two files, <i>managed-schema</i> and <i>solrconfig.xml</i>.
</p>

<subsection name="Create Collection">

<p>
To create registry collection in Solr from default configset with one shard and one replica,
run the following Registry Manager command
</p>
<source>
registry-manager create-registry
</source>

<p>
You can customize <i>create-registry</i> command by passing several parameters. 
To see the list of available parameters, run
</p>
<source>
registry-manager create-registry -help
</source>

<p>
To check that registry collection was created open the following URL in 
a browser: <i>http://localhost:8983/solr/registry/schema</i> or use <i>curl</i>
if it is available on your system (Linux, Mac)
<source>
curl 'http://localhost:8983/solr/registry/schema'
</source>
</p>

<p>
You can also go to Solr admin UI at <i>http://localhost:8983/solr/</i> and select 
registry collection from a dropdown on the left as shown below.

<br/>
<p>
<b>NOTE:</b> If you run Solr in Docker / Podman, make sure that Solr started in cloud mode 
and ZooKeeper port (9983) is mapped. 
</p>
<p>
You can connect to remote ZooKeeper (and Solr) cluster by passing <i>-zkHost</i> parameter.
</p>
<p>
You can also use standard ZooKeeper and Solr tools instead of Registry Manager to create 
and manage registry collection.
</p>

<subsection name="Delete Collection">
<p>
To delete registry collection from Solr run the following command.
</p>
<source>
registry-manager delete-registry
</source>

You may want to add more fields to default schema or change default Solr configuration.
