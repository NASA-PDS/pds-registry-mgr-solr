<section name="Java Runtime Environment">

<p>
Both Apache Solr and PDS Registry tools require Java Runtime Environment to run. 
Recommended version of Java is 11.
</p>

<p>
To test if Java is already installed on your system, run the following command from a command prompt:
</p>
<source>
java -version
</source>

<p>
If Java is already installed, you will see a message similar to this:
</p>
<source>
openjdk version "11.0.5" 2019-10-15
OpenJDK Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.5+10)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.5+10, mixed mode)
</source>

<p>
It is recommended to have JDK 11 installed. JDK/JRE 8 (1.8) might work, 
but development and testing of PDS Registry and other tools is mostly done with JDK 11.
</p>

<p>There are several distributions of Java:
<ul>
<li>Open JDK (Free). Can be downloaded from different sites, for example, 
<a href="https://adoptopenjdk.net/" target="_blank">adoptopenjdk.net</a>. 
Most Linux distributions have Open JDK in their standard repositories.</li>
<li>Oracle JDK (Commercial). Can be downloaded from 
<a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/" target="_blank">www.oracle.com</a>. 
You must register and accept a license to download.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
If you want to keep several versions of JDK (e.g., 8 and 11), you can download .zip or .tar.gz archives instead of .msi or .pkg files 
and manually unzip them. Then you can set JAVA_HOME environment variable to choose which version of JDK to run.
